# ENGLISH LISTENING PLACEMENT TEST

## Stage 1 toward a reliable, comprehensive English language placement test aligned to CEFR levels

This project is a **simple web-based English listening placement test**.  
It is designed as an **early prototype (Stage 1)** in the development of a reliable and comprehensive English language placement test aligned to the **CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages)**.

The application focuses specifically on **listening skills** and is intended for educational and research purposes.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Full CEFR Range:** Covers levels from A1 (Beginner) to C2 (Mastery)
- **Progressive Difficulty:** Tests users across realistic scenarios, from supermarket announcements to architectural critiques
- **Anti-Skip Logic:** Users must listen to each audio at least once before answering, supporting more valid results
- **Session Persistence:** Uses local storage so users can resume an unfinished test if they close the browser
- **Data Export:** Completed results can be exported in **JSON** or **CSV** format for further analysis

## 🌐 Live Demo

You can try the application here:

👉 **https://andywatkin01.github.io/English_placement_listening_test/**

No installation is required — it runs directly in your web browser.

---

## 📌 Project Purpose

- To explore the design of a **listening-based placement test**
- To support future development of a **CEFR-aligned English assessment**
- To provide a foundation for further stages, improvements, and validation

This version is intentionally **simple** and will evolve over time.

## 🛠️ Built With

This project was built using basic web technologies:

- **HTML** – structure and content  
- **CSS** – layout and visual styling  
- **JavaScript** – interactivity, scoring logic, and state management  

No external libraries or frameworks are used.

## 🗂️ Project Structure

- `index.html` – Core structure and user interface  
- `app.js` – Audio playback, scoring logic, and state management  
- `styles.css` – Custom styling for a clean, mobile-responsive test environment

## 🧪 Installation (for developers)

To run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository  
2. Use a local server environment (for example, VS Code’s **Live Server** extension), as the app uses `fetch()` to load JSON data  
3. Open `index.html` through the local server

## 📈 Future Development

Planned improvements include:

- Additional listening items for **school-aged learners** and **business English** contexts
- Improved scoring logic
- Clearer CEFR level mapping
- User feedback and analytics
- Accessibility enhancements
